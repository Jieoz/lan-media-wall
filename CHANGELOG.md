# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are git tags that trigger CI cloud-builds and Release artifact attachment.

## [v1.0.2] — 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **broker-build release path**: the broker lane runs with `working-directory: broker`, so PyInstaller emits to `broker/dist/...`, but the upload + release-attach steps still pointed at `dist/...`. The two broker binaries never attached on v1.0.1. Paths corrected to `broker/dist/...`.

### Result
- All four CI lanes green (`ci`, `windows-build`, `android-build`, `flutter-build`, `broker-build`).
- Release v1.0.2 attaches all 7 artifacts: 4 controller/player APKs, the Windows installer, and both `lmw-broker` (Linux ELF) + `lmw-broker.exe`.

## [v1.0.1] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- `flutter-build.yml` — cloud-build the `remote_flutter` controller APK (per-ABI release splits, ~14–19 MB instead of the 141 MB debug).
- `broker-build.yml` — PyInstaller onefile lane for standalone `lmw-broker` binaries.
- Slimmed all artifacts: split-per-ABI release APKs, Windows installer measured under the 60 MB ceiling.

### Fixed
- Robust mpv runtime download in `windows-build` (GitHub mirror primary, SourceForge fallback with a proper UA); avoid self-copy when mpv extracts to the runtime root.

### Known issue (fixed in v1.0.2)
- broker binaries did not attach to the release due to a `dist/` vs `broker/dist/` path mismatch.

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Phase 1** — protocol contract (`protocol_spec.md` v1) plus three ends against it:
  - **broker** (Python, asyncio): WS/WSS server, signed-envelope auth (HMAC-SHA256 + ts window + msg_id dedup), device registry + grouping with atomic `state.json`, master clock + SNTP-style `time_sync`, three-phase `prepare→ready→play_at` sync state machine, UDP discovery, thumbnail relay. 27 unit tests + end-to-end smoke.
  - **windows_player** (Python + mpv via JSON IPC): reconnect, resumable Range downloads + sha256, kiosk fullscreen-topmost + taskbar hide, watchdog crash recovery + `resume_last`. 34 unit tests, OS-coupled paths import-guarded for cross-platform CI.
  - **remote_flutter** (Flutter controller): device wall, playlist editor, prefetch, synced play, per-group volume/mute/audio-master, group assignment; byte-for-byte canonical-JSON HMAC alignment with the Python ends.
- **Phase 2** — native **Android Kotlin player** (Media3/ExoPlayer), behaviorally on par with the Windows player; protocol bumped to **v1.1** (backward-compatible additions: `prepare_id` sync-session correlation, `wall.devices[]` field set, `welcome` fields, `controller_presence`, `time_sync_ack.req_msg_id`).
- GitHub Actions cloud-build for the Windows exe and Android APK.
